# uboat-analysis

An analysis of WWII Uboat attack data, using R Markdown.

This R Markdown Notebook aims to explore the German Uboat attack dataset from WWII. It aims to not only conduct an analysis, but to be educational to the reader and explain the steps taken.

## The data

The data was obtained from [this Github repo](https://github.com/kadenhendron/uboat-data/tree/master/data), which was sourced ultimately from [this site](http://www.uboats.net/index.html). The data is saved as two seperate CSV files, being `uboat_data.csv` and `uboat_target_data.csv`. Details and explanations of the data is explained further in the R Markdown notebook.

## The focus

The focus of this analysis was to conduct a motivated exploratory data analysis driven by curiosity. It was primarily graphical data analysis heavy, and of course featured a range of data cleaning up front.

The R Markdown file (`uboats_example.rmd`) contains the actual R code blocks and markdown. The PDF (`uboats_example.pdf`) contains a published version of the Notebook aimed more for presentation and consumption by end users.

The project ended up with a light example of modelling, and there is no current intent to continue working on this as I have achieved everything I intended with this project. It was a thoroughly enjoyable dataset to explore.
